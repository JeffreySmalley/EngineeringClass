Everyone should make their own worlds and add unique enemies/obstacles to them
since Unity is stupid easy.

Each world should consist of 2 running levels and 1 boss level.

I(Trevor) will be doing 2 worlds since I already started making another one.

We need someone to script the Boss level player script(Free movement, shooting)

Since I already did the Running player script, Jeff or Mike will do that.

Mike has been working on the title screen so that should be done.

We need Health/Lives and a game over screen, etc. Maybe an Overworld if we feel
fancy.

That's pretty much all, just writing this to keep everyone on track.
